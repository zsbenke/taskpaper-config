## What This Is

These are some of my significant TaskPaper files. They might be useful in helping you get started with being a TaskPaper power user with a minimum of fussing and fiddling.

### ðŸ“‚ Config Files

One is a Style Sheet (**`style.less`**), while the others provide "Set It and Forget It" defaults that I like to have available in every TaskPaper document. Any and all can be edited to suit your needs.

* **`searches.taskpaper`** is the equivalent of "Saved Searches" or, if you like "Smart Tasklists." Not dissimilar to a _very_ simple version of what OmniFocus calls a _perspective_.
* **`tags.taskpaper`** ensures that all my favorite "tags" (think: <abbr title="Getting Things Done">GTD</abbr> contexts) should be available and autofillable in all my TaskPaper documents.

## To Install Config Files

**PLEASE** proceed carefully, know what you're doing, and please make backups before you do or change anything

Run `./install.sh` to override your existing TaskPaper config.
